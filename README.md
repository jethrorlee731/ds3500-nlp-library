# taylor_swift_textacular_analysis

I helped to create a series of complex visualizations to understand the nature of Taylor Swift's songwriting style and infer why she's had such a successful career. We crafted many visualizations to analyze Taylor Swift’s writing style. These include a Sankey chart linking her songs to certain lyrics, word clouds, a scatter plot comparing a song's negative sentiment score with its positive sentiment score, sentiment analysis bar charts for each song, boxplots about the lengths of the words for each song, a bar chart comparing the average length of the words in each song, and a box plot summarizing the length of the words for all the files combined.  The text files we chose in this project represent one from each of Swift’s albums. With each of the visualizations, we were able to draw different conclusions when analyzing word counts, word lengths, and sentiment tones to try and understand why the results are the way they are and any trends or discrepancies that are present in Swift’s style of composing.
